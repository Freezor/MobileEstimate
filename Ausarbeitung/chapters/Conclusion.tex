\chapter{Conclusion}

This paper presented the possibility to process \textit{cost estimation} with a mobile application. It tries to give an approach to make projects \textit{comparable} and build a base for a mobile cost estimation application. It focuses on the implementation of \textit{Function Point} and makes a complete estimation possible.\\
The developed application allows a comparison between projects. It relies on \textit{seven} different project properties. These are calculated with a distance which gives the \textit{total difference} of two projects. \\
To use the application properly it is assumed that the user knows how the estimation techniques work. He has the possibility to use the help inside the application but a basic understanding is required.\\
One of the biggest problems was to create a user interface which inherits all functions to estimate a project and also supports the android design principles.\\
Another problem was to create a logical algorithm for comparing projects. The biggest problem was to find properties which can be compared and can be set for every project. These properties must also have relevance for the algorithm.\\
As an outlook for further development are many features and additions possible. One addition is to implement more estimation techniques such as \textit{COCOMO}. This would support more informations about how long a project can take. Because different technique have a different effort as output. Another addition is to create a server which stores all estimations from the user. This would support more possibilities to improve the estimations. All users with access can rely on the informations of other users. It could also allow sharing of the projects. A server management tool would provide the possibility to manage the master data of the project comparison from the server. Adaption of the application for tablets would provide the possibility for more functionalities and different user experience. Also the comparison functionality has to be refined and it must be evaluated if more project properties are necessary to get more exact results.\\
All in all it can be said, that the mobile application for cost estimations offers a promising alternative to the traditional estimation software, that is worth further research and evaluation.
