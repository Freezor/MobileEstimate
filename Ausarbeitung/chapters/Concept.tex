\chapter{Application concept}

This chapter describes the project plan and the concepts for the developed application. These concepts are foundation of the developed application and describe how the internal processes in the application work.


\section{Project planning}

First step for this project was analyzing the features from existing cost estimation software as described in section \ref{sec:stateofart}. \\
The next step was creating a GUI prototype to show how the estimation would look like on a smartphone.\\
The definition of the wanted features for the application was done regular meetings with my supervisor Prof. Dr. Georg Rock. Those features request were compiled into the project goals and requirements. The development were performed with the iterative method, where the set project steps where performed and in a meeting reviewed. This resulted in the next iteration step and further requirements.

\subsection{Objectives}\label{objectives}

The project targets are the benefit the application should bring the user. They are linked with the requirements from section \ref{requirements} and describe the condition to be achieved with the application. Whereas requirements can change over time, targets stay the same.\\
Most important target, as described in table \ref{projecttargets}, is T01. 'The application must allow a quick and mobile cost estimation of IT Projects' describes that the cost estimation has to be implemented for mobile device use. Also, the cost estimation has to be fast and can use features of the mobile platform to achieve this target.\\
As the developed application is only a beta version, it has to be developed modular for future feature implementation, as described in T04.\\
T06 describes the target that represents an admired feature. The application should provide the possibility to compare projects and measure their relation. This allows to check previous projects for their cost estimation, that the user has a reference how much effort similar projects took.\\
The target for this bachelor thesis is to implement the function point estimation technique. This is the showcase for this application and shows the possibility of cost estimations for software project on mobile devices and is described in T09.\\
All remaining targets are medium priority and describe what processes to achieve with this project.\\

\subsection{Requirements}\label{requirements}

All requirements for the implemented application are based on the targets from section \ref{objectives} and the regular meetings. Those are all implemented in the developed application. This section describes the requirements for project creation in detail. All other requirements can be found in the appendix.\\
Table \ref{projectrequirementsprojectcreation} describes the requirements for the project creation. As most features in the application work with projects, those are one of the most important requirements. The requirements make sure that projects are created correctly and allow the algorithm for related project to find all projects that are related.\\

\subsection{Cost Estimation}
For the evaluation of the needed time, the project was estimated with the function point technique. Therefor all functionalities are grouped into functional groups, as described by Poensgen \cite{FPKompakt}. Afterwards each function was assigned a category for the estimation, as described in \ref{fpcomponents}.\\
The group Project, as described in \ref{fig:projectFunctionalityGroup}, inherits all functions for a project. All function groups for the application can be found in the application.
The project functionalities in \ref{fig:projectFunctionalityGroup} are created with the requirements. Some requirements can be grouped into one functionality. As an example the function Create/Edit project inherits all requirements described in table \ref{projectrequirementsprojectcreation}. This function is marked as an EI and ILF because all changes are made by the user for this function and creates or edit all internal files for the project. \\
Functions that expects an input from the user are marked as EI, like delete project. Output functions like show estimated cost are a EO function, because they only display values and results to the user. Functions with a calculation are described as EQ combined with EO if they produce an output like Export Project or process an Input like Change Estimation.

	\label{fig:projectFunctionalityGroup}
\end{figure}\\
Summed up the project has total 246 function points. The total functional group can be found in the appendix. \\
As described in section \ref{FPMethod}, the next step is to set the influence factors. There is no direct communication between the application and other software. It uses some functionalities for sending data to other applications, which is the reason why the influence factor 'Integration into other applications' is set to 2.
Completed with the equation from \ref{FPMethod} the influence factor multiplier is 0.99. 
\\
The complete equation of the estimation results in 243.54 points. Calculated with the points per day from table \ref{tab:pointsperday} the project is estimated to take 14 days.
